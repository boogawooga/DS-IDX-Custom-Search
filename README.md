# DS-IDX-Custom-Search-Widget

An effort is to create a custom widget with the DS IDX API that will allow custom filtering outside of the global filter settings 

Site is at Twilliamsrealty.com - the header form "Search Orcas Island" is a text widget with form code that returns 
property listings from ORCAS ISLAND only. 

The DS IDX Plugin provides a "Search Widget" but it doesn't allow specific filtering outside of the global site-wide 
filtering. 

For this specific project / client We need this property search widget to show / filter: 
1. Properties in Orcas Island ONLY 
2. Will NOT return "sold" properties 
3. Will redirect to mobile results if user is using a mobile device 
4. Will have the ability to create / change custom filters when inserting the Search Widget - outside of the global filtering that is part of the plugin settings
